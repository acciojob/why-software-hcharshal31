    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>The motivation behind becoming the software developer is that since I was a 10 to 12 years old I was always wandering how the technologies are working, How the phones are working, what is the logic behind their functioning. All these things always made me curious about the technology. As I started growing I started to understand that all this things are the doings of software developers and becouse of that I also wanted to become one.</p>
